# Contributing to LLocal
Contributing, does not just mean implementing new features but rather inclusive of that as well as raising issues, making bug fixes, improving the documentation, just aiming to make someone or a bunch/community of peoples work easier.

## Making a first contribution
- Fork the repository
- Implement changes or additions that you feel would be necessary
- Push the addition/changes to the main branch of your forked repo
- Raise a PR (Pull request)

## Style guidelines
- Make sure, you add appropriate comments explaining your thought process at relevant intervals. Making the code readable and enjoyable.
- The commits should be following the conventional github commit messages (can be referenced here: [refer](https://gist.github.com/qoomon/5dfcdf8eec66a051ecd85625518cfd13)) 

## Additional notes
- All of us are consistently learning, and I genuinely believe that we should go headfirst in the things we are scared off. So, if you're unsure/scared you should totally fork the repo and have fun with it.
- I built this so I can give back and learn with the community, so if nothing I really hope you have fun and learn from the project.
- Also, thank you so much for even taking your time to reading this let alone considering to contribute. The idea that someone I don't know reads this boggles my mind.
